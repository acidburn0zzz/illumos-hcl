This toolset exists to automatically generate a Hardware Compatibility List from
a given illumos workspace. On illumos-based system with a copy of the
illumos-gate which is pointed to by the environment variable WS_ROOT, do the
following:

 1) Update the makefile to point to a different gcc if necessary
 2) Run make
 3) Run ./parser $WS_ROOT/usr/src/pkg/manifests > hcl.html
 4) scp hcl.html illumos_header.png to your webserver of choice

Note that this currently contains copies of libraries and tools that are slowly
making their way into illumos. The libraries and files here are not intended for
use in any other environment and their construction is clearly not ideal for any
other use.
